# Estimating nuisance variables

We have discussed how to estimate $p$.

Next we will discuss how to estimate $q$ based on distance sampling.

***

# So why is this important?

$$E[Y]=NC=(AD)(pq)=qpAD$$
$$\hat{D}=E[Y]/(A\hat{p}\hat{q})$$

# Corrections

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="300px"}
include_graphics("../images/qpad_fig5.png")
```

The corrections can be used to adjust for different methodologies
and other factors influencing availability and detectability.

Density estimates using different corrections in 5 types of land cover

# Integrating projects

1. Normalize and join data from projects,
2. take multiple-duration subset and fit removal models,
3. take multiple-distance subset and fit distance sampling models,
4. predict $p$ and $g$ for all surveys,
5. use $log(Apq)$ offsets in log-linear models with total counts as response.

Removal and distance models can deal with multiple methodologies in the same model.

Each modeling step can include covariates, which can be the same.

***

# Advantages of this approach

- Smaller parameter space,
- less colinearity,
- straightforward model selection,
- quicker than joint modeling via integrated likelihood.
