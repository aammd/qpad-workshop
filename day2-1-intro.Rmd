# Where were we?

$E[Y]=NC=DAC=DApq$

***

# What is detectability?

In the most colloquial terms, $\delta$ is the probability
that a species is detected given it is present:

$$P(Y>0 \mid N>0)$$

***

# Occupancy

In an occupancy framework, we can have:

- A detection: true positives (false positive rate is 0)
  - $P(Y>0) = P(Y>0 \mid N>0) P(N>0) + P(Y>0 \mid N=0) P(N=0)$
  - $P(Y>0) = \delta \varphi + 0 (1-\varphi) = \delta \varphi$
- A non-detection: false negatives + true negatives
  - $P(Y=0) = P(Y=0 \mid N>0) P(N>0) + P(Y=0 \mid N=0) P(N=0)$
  - $P(Y=0) = (1-\delta) \varphi + 1 (1-\varphi) = 1- \delta \varphi$,

(These are the marginal probabilities used to estimate the parameters using maximum likelihood.)

***

# Side note on occupancy

People often confuse these two conditional probabilities:

1. Observing 0 given that the species is present:
  - $P(Y=0 \mid N>0) = 1-\delta$
2. Presence of a species given that we observe 0 (we ask this question _after_ observing the data):
  - $P(N> 0 \mid Y=0) = \frac{P(Y=0 \mid N>0) P(N>0)}{P(Y=0)}$
  - $\frac{(1-\delta)\varphi}{\varphi (1-\delta) + (1-\varphi)} = \frac{\varphi (1-\delta)}{1-\delta \varphi}$

***

# Abundance

A lot more combinations of true abundance and observed counts:

|   | $Y$ = 0  |  1 | 2  |  ... |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  $N$ = 0 | x  |   |   |   |
|  1 |  x | x  |   |   |
| 2  |  x | x  |  x |   |
| ...  | x  | x  | x  | x  |

***

# Estimating detectability

To estimate $\delta$, we need:

- ancillary information (multiple visits, distance bands, time intervals, multiple observers),
- parametric model assumptions (i.e. $\delta$ varies across locations).

***

# The myth of constant detectability

Detectability zealots often view a method that cannot estimate
constant detection probability $\delta$ 
(e.g. single-visit occupancy and N-mixture models) as inferior.

Fortunately for the rest of us: $\delta$ can only be constant
in very narrow situations, e.g. when surveys are conducted:

- in the same region,
- in similar habitat,
- in the same year,
- on the same day,
- at the same time,
- by the same observer,
- using the same protocol.

***

# Constant detectability is rare

Often a consequence of small sample size (i.e.
not a lot of detection for a species)[^1][^2]:

# Let's unwrap $\delta$

1. Once the species/individual is present ($N>0$),
2. it needs to make itself heard/visible, make itself available ($p$) -- we have just discussed this,
3. then it needs to be detected by an observer (either in the field or in the lab listening to a recording) -- let's call this probability $q$.

These imply a set total time duration and maximum counting radius.

***

# QPAD

Now we can expand our equation:
$E[Y]=NC=(AD)(pq)=qpAD$

The expected value of the observed count becomes a function of the:

- population density ($D$),
- area sampled ($A$),
- availability ($p$),
- and perceptibility ($q$).

***

# Space and time to the rescue

\centering
```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="190px"}
include_graphics("../images/qpad_fig2.png")
```

$p$ is a monotonic function of _time_, while $q$ is monotonic function of _area_ (space).

# Availability varies

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="300px"}

```

***

# Availability really varies

\centering
```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="200px"}

```

***

# Biological mechanisms

- Migration timing drives phenology for many species, e.g. ordinal day of year (`DAY`),
- when study spans across biomes, use time since local spring (multi-year average),
- or time since spring green up, last snow day, etc. based on actual survey year,
- time of day,
- time since local sunrise (`TSSR`).

***

# Perceptibility varies too

\centering
```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="300px"}
include_graphics("../images/qpad_fig4.png")
```

***

# Estimating nuisance variables

We have discussed how to estimate $p$.

Next we will discuss how to estimate $q$ based on distance sampling.

***

# So why is this important?

$$E[Y]=NC=(AD)(pq)=qpAD$$
$$\hat{D}=E[Y]/(A\hat{p}\hat{q})$$

***

# Corrections

\centering
```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="300px"}

```

The corrections can be used to adjust for different methodologies
and other factors influencing availability and detectability.

***

# Integrating projects

1. Normalize and join data from projects,
2. take multiple-duration subset and fit removal models,
3. take multiple-distance subset and fit distance sampling models,
4. predict $p$ and $g$ for all surveys,
5. use $log(Apq)$ offsets in log-linear models with total counts as response.

Removal and distance models can deal with multiple methodologies in the same model.

Each modeling step can include covariates, which can be the same.

***

# Advantages of this approach

- Smaller parameter space,
- less colinearity,
- straightforward model selection,
- quicker than joint modeling via integrated likelihood.
